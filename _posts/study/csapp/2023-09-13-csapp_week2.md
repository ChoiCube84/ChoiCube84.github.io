# 시작

이 글에서는 2023년 9월 11일과 13일에 컴퓨터 SW시스템 개론 수업에서 배운 내용들을 정리해보도록 하겠다.

### Word-Oriented Memory Organization

- Addresses specify byte locations
  - Address of the `first` byte in word
  - Addresses of succesive words differ by 4 (32-bits) or 8 (64-bit)

### Byte Ordering

How should bytes within a multi-byte word be ordered in memory?

- Conventions
  
  - Big endian: Sun, PowerPC Mac, internet
    - The most significant byte comes first
  
  - Little endian: x86
    - The least significant byte comes first

- Examples
  
  0xDEADBEEF를 저장해보자.

  - Big endian
  
    | 0xDE | 0xAD | 0xBE | 0xEF | 데드비프!

  - Little endian

    | 0xEF | 0xBE | 0xAD | 0xDE | ~~(엡베아떼?)~~
    

### Representing Strings

- Strings in C
  
  - Represented by an array of characters

  - Each character encoded in ASCII format
    - Standard 7-bit encoding of character set

    - Digit character "i"  has code 0x30 + i

  - String should be null-terminated
    - Final character = "0"

- Compatibility
  - Byte ordering not an issue


### Fractional Binary Numbers

- Representation
  
  - Bits to right of `binary point` represent fractional powers of 2

  - Represents rational number: $\displaystyle\sum_{k=-j}^{i}{b_k \times 2^k}$

### Representable Numbers

- Limitation #1
  
  - Can only exactly represent numbers of the form $x/2^k$
    
    - Other rational numbers have repeating bit representations

    - 나 이거 코딩애플에서 봤어!

- Limitation #2

  - Just one setting of decimal poitn within the $w$ bits -> Limited range of numbers (very small values? very large?)

### IEEE Floating Point

- IEEE Standard 754

  - Established in 1985 as uniform standard for floating point arithmetic
    - Before that, many idiosyncratic formats

  - Supported by all major CPUs

- Driven by numerical concerns

  - Nice standards for rounding, overflow, underflow, etc.

  - Hard to make fast in hardware
    - Numerical analysts predominated over hardware designers in defining standard

### Floating Point Representation (Format)

- Numerical form: $(-1)^s \times M \times 2^E$

  - `Sign bit s` determines whether number is negative or positive

  - `Significand M` normally a fractional value in range $[1.0, 2.0)$

  - `Exponenet E` weights value by power of two

- Encoding

  - MSB $s$ is sign bit `s`
  - Exp field $e$ encodes `E` (not exactly the same as E)
  - Frac field $f$ encodes `M` (not exactly the same as M)

### Precisions

- Single precision: 32 bits
  - 1, 8, 23

- Double precision: 64 bits
  - 1, 11, 52

- Extended precision (Intel only): 80 bits
  - 1, 15, 63 or 64
