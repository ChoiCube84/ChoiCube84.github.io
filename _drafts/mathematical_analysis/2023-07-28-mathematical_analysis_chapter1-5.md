## 문제 풀이

### Exercise 1

만약 $r$ 이 유리수이고 $(r \neq 0)$ $x$ 가 무리수라면, $r+x$ 와 $rx$ 가 무리수임을 증명하라.

#### 해설(WIP)

Assume $r+x$ is rational. Then, $p=r+x$ is rational, $x=p-r$ is rational as well. But $x$ is irrational. So $r+x$ is irrational. Assume $rx$ is rational. Then, $q=rx$ is rational, $x=q/r$ is rational as well. (Note that $r \neq 0$.) But $x$ is irrational. So $rx$ is rational. $\blacksquare$

### Exercise 2

제곱하여 $12$ 가 되는 유리수가 없음을 증명하라.

#### 해설(WIP)

Assume there is a rational number $p$ whose square is $12$. Then, $p^2=12$. Since $p$ is a rational number, we can express $p=m/n$ for integers $m$ and $n$ that are coprime. Then, $p^2=m^2/n^2=12$, $m^2=12n^2$. Since $m^2$ is a even number, $m$ is also an even number, so we can express $m=2k$ for an integer $k$. Then, $4k^2=12n^2$, $k^2=3n^2$. Since $k^2$ can be divided by $3$, $k$ also can be divided by $3$. So we can express $k=3l$ for an integer $l$. Now, $9l^2=3n^2$, $n^2=3l^2$. Again, we can see that $n$ can be divided by $3$, but since $k$ can be divided by $3$, $m=2k$ can be divided by $3$. This contradicts our assumption thaat $m$ and $n$ are coprime. So tehre's no rational number whose square is $12$. $\blacksquare$
